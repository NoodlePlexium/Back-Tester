# Back-Tester
A Backtesting Script I written in Python, used for testing algo trading strategies. 

- Takes a csv dataframe containing OHLC values as an input. 
- Outputs strategy results and plots an equity curve.

# Outputs
- Trade count
- Profit Count
- Winrate
- Sharpe Ratio
- Drawndown
- Equity Curve

- Supports Commission

# In Future Updates
- I may migrate the system to an Object Oriented approach
- Possibly functionality for Trailing stops & Limit orders
- Eventually more visual data representation will be included
- More strategy result metrics
